"""
Top-level initializer for the entire patch system.

Responsibilities:
1. Dynamically discover and import all category-level patches under patch/ 
   (e.g. attention, worker, models).
2. For each category, load version-specific patches (hard-coded to patch_0_8_5).
3. Install the RedirectFinder into sys.meta_path to intercept all future imports.
4. Retroactively apply module redirects, function/method/variable patches,
   and exec-hooks to any modules already imported.
